Trie-Compress
=============

Briefly implement algorithms introduced in "Compressing IP Forwarding Tables: Towards Entropy Bounds and Beyond A revised technical report", mainly contains algorithms about compressing the Trie structure.

Algorithms include(plan):

*   original binary Trie
*   Path-compress Trie(omitted)
*   ORTC algorithm
*   level compress trie
*   XBW-b implementation

Also, a visualized tree can be used to view the transform of different algorithms.
